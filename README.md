# Technologie-Web-php-html-css-
The objective of the project is to create a site which implements the principles of web development seen throughout the Web Technologies module.


I used the MVCR architecture, with in particular a good separation of business classes (the model), display (views), management of HTTP requests (router), management of actions (controllers), data validation (builders), and database storage details.

Basic realization
the basic functions detailed below.

Without authentication, a user has access to:
the list of all the objects (but not the detail).
the account creation page.
an about page that contains:
group number, student numbers of group members
list the points achieved (in particular the complements, see below).
the distribution of tasks in the group.
the main choices in terms of design, modeling, code, etc ...
anything you think is useful to tell us.
Authenticated users can:
see the detail page of each object.
add new objects.
modify / delete the objects which belong to him (but not those of the others).
